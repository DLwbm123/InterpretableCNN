# InterpretableCNN

This is the implementation of [
Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00935)

Just create new two folders: data and weights for storing data and weights respectively.

Run the `dataset.py` to automatically download CUB data and store it in data folder

Start training with `main.py`
